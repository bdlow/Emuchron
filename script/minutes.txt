# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose:
# Use repeat loop to quickly skip through the minutes of one
# hour and see how a clock redraws itself
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
#
# Usage example (with analog HM):
# cs 2
# e s ../script/minutes.txt
#

# Repeat m(inute) between 0..59
rw m < 60 0 1
  # Change the time using the 'm' variable
  # This will update the layout of the selected clock
  ts 16 m 30
  # Wait 0.2 second
  w 20
# Next m(inute)
